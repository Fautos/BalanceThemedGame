# BalanceThemedGame
 Game for the [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025), you can play the game in this [link](https://fautos.itch.io/)

This game was developed for a game jam with the theme "**Balance**". The idea is to create a unique experience where you play as a prisoner, trying to earn enough reputation to secure your release. However, with a rising reputation, you also become increasingly disliked by your fellow inmates, who will do everything in their power to make your life difficult. The key to escaping prison lies in carefully _balancing_ your reputation: you need enough to be released, but not too much, or else your fellow prisoners will make sure you never make it out alive.
